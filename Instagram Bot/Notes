XPATH and the selectors change every time you access the page! That's because they are dynamically generated on
Instagram's side, so each time you visit the page, the elements will be different.

You'll need to use contains() and text() in your XPATH. For example, to find a button that has the words "Click me" on
a page, you can use:

   button = driver.find_element(by=By.XPATH, value="//button[contains(text(), 'Click me')]")

The WebDriverWait class is used to wait until the element is present on the page.
this is how you import the class

    from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
    from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
